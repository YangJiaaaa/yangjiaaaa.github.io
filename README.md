# Academic Interests


## Bioinformatics: :shipit:

Metagenomics is a study of genomic sequences obtained directly from an environment, which allows researchers to create a picture of an environment's microbial life without the need to isolate and culture individual microbes. However, the huge amount of computation poses a great challenge to the current method. To solve this problem directly, I am working on developing and optimizing the algorithm by using Deep Learning and do the research of this field.

## Quantitative Investment: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Trying to develop rapidly growing strategy that uses complex computer models to make trading decisions and taking a blow to its reputation with the current markets troubles.
